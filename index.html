            Doctor's Fear - Nature's Sweetest Medicine<br>
Welcome to Doctor's Fear, your friendly neighborhood apple sellers from the beautiful valleys of Kashmir. We're a family-owned business that's been growing and selling the juiciest, crunchiest apples for over 30 years. Our story began when our grandfather planted his first apple tree, and since then, we've been hooked on these round wonders!
Our orchards are nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, where the cool mountain air and rich soil help our apples grow big and tasty. We take pride in growing our fruit the old-fashioned way - with lots of care and no harmful chemicals. From the classic Red Delicious to the tangy Kinnaur, we've got all your favorite Indian apple varieties.
At Doctor's Fear, we believe that a good apple can brighten anyone's day. That's why we work hard to bring you the best apples at fair prices. Whether you're looking for a healthy snack, a gift for a loved one, or ingredients for your famous apple halwa, we've got you covered. Remember, an apple a day keeps the doctor away - and that's why we're the doctor's biggest fear!
